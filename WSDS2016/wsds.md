## Where we are now?

- How well are women *actually* represented in the R community? And in what capacity?
    - Conferences
    - Packages
    - Google Summer of Code
    - R Foundation, R Core
    - Publications
    - R-Ladies

## 2010 Survey of Packages

- 2010 survey of 1087 maintainers of packages on CRAN/Bioconductor plus contributors on 
R-forge&#185;
- 9% of package authors were women (95% CI: 7.1 - 11.0%)
- 32.5% were from the USA

## Conferences

- useR! has already been working to improve diversity
    - gradual increase in number of female keynotes
    - code of conduct introduced in 2015
    - diversity scholarships & mothers' room in 2016
    
<img height = "350" src="user_invited.svg">

## useR! 2015 

- [http://user2015.math.aau.dk](http://user2015.math.aau.dk)
- ~19% participants were women
- ~20% of presentations

![useR! 2015 breakdown by presentation and gender](user2015.png)

<!-- possibly Rencontres stats here: 4/16 talks, 6/11 posters, 3/10 lightning -->

## R Packages

 - All CRAN maintainers (Mar 2016) processed with **genderizer**
    - uses databases to predict gender from first name
 - Supplemented by manual assignment
 - 14.8% package authors "female", 11.4% with P(gender) &ge; 0.8
 
 <img height="300" src="genderizer_authors.svg">

## Other R Project Contributions

 - 18% Google Summer of Code 2015 mentors were women (9 individuals)
 - In remaining cases, percentages represent one or two women
 
<img height="350" src="rproject.svg">

## Publications: JCGS

<img height="550" src="JCGS.png">

## Where should we be?

## US Students

 - US National Center for Education Statistics (2013-14)
 - Computer science ranges from 18% (Bachelor's) to 29% (Master's) female
 - Others range from 29% to 58% female
 
 <img height="350" src="useduc.svg">
 
## US Occupations

 - Data from American Community Survey 2014
 - 22% female programmers
 - Other scientific/analytic occupations at least 41% female
 
  <img height="350" src="us_census.svg">
  
## Goals for R Community

 - Developers (CRAN maintainers, GSoC students, ISC funding holders) should at 
 least be comparable to computer science figures
    - &gt; 20% women
 - Broader user community (R conference attendees/speakers, RUG members) should at least be comparable to mathematical/natural sciences
    - 30-40% women
    
    <br>
 
## How can we get there?
<br>

- Keep data
- Build developer capacity
- Community support

<br>

- Some already active, other prompted to act as ambassadors

> <small>I am actually working with the conference committee on funding a female 
> grad student or post doc to go to the conference ...
> I will definitely get the word out</br>
> -- Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, email</small>

<!--- http://www.meetup.com/R-ladies/messages/boards/thread/49654757#129001411 --->
> <small>I'm making myself available to help on giving feedback, helping on ideas, 
> reviews of abstracts, etc. I would love to see more R-ladies presenting at useR!</br>
> -- Gabriela de Queiroz, message on meetup</small>

<!---
## Recommendations for Future useR!s

 - Maintain current gender balance for invited speakers
 - Aim for similar gender balance for tutors
     - 28% tutorials have woman tutor this year
 - Consider favouring women on borderline abstracts
</br> 
</br>
 - useR! 2017 proposal includes offering childcare
     
    <br>

## Effectiveness of Email Campaigns

 - The Society for Political Methodology Summer Meeting ran a randomised control 
 trial to test effect of personalised invitations&#185;
     - 3945 graduate students in Top 50 political science programs
     - treatment group received 2 emails, control received none
 - Those in the treatment group are more likely to apply
     - some evidence women responded more strongly
 - BUT acceptance rates in treatment group lower than in control
 - Problems in application to R community
    - identifying target population
    - risk of putting people off that are invited but not accepted
    
<small>&#185;Unkovic C, Sen M, Quinn KM (2016) Does Encouragement Matter in Improving Gender Imbalances in Technical Fields? Evidence from a Randomized Controlled Trial. PLoS ONE 11(4): e0151714.</small>

## 10 Simple Rules to Achieve Gender-Balanced Program&#185;

1. Collect the Data
2. Develop a Speaker Policy (Targets)
3. Make the Policy Visible
4. Establish a Balanced and Informed Program Committee
5. Report the Data

<small>&#185;Martin JL (2014) Ten Simple Rules to Achieve Conference Speaker Gender Balance. PLoS Comput Biol 10(11): e1003903.</small>

---

6. Build and Use Databases
    - currently nothing specific to R community
7. Respond to Resistance
    - meritocracy argument ignores (unconscious) bias & systematic disadvantage
8. Support Women at Meetings

    > If you're going to spend money on an open bar instead of childcare… 
    > you should rethink what you're doing</br>
    > -- Jonathan Eisen
    
9. Be Family Friendly

---

10. Take the Pledge
    - When invited, ask to see conference speaker policy first
        - help draft one if it doesn't exist!
    - Ask to see list of invited people
        - if poor gender balance, point this out!
        - suggest female speakers/give joint talk with female colleague

## Objectives

> Women-only spaces are a hack
> -- Julia Evans, http://jvns.ca

* Women-only or female-majority events can help women feel safer

* Goal is NOT to segregate by gender but to provide a gateway to community at 
large
--->

## R User Groups

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
<div>
* 237 local RUGs
* Heading for 20 RUG meetings per week, somewhere in the world
* Short talks, "show and tell"
</div>
<div style="flex-basis: 120%"><img height = 400 src="france_rug.jpg"></div>
</div>

## RUGs as a Springboard

- Opportunity for women
    - practice public speaking (conference format)
    - get feedback on projects
    - relatively low-cost (short talk, local venue)
   
- Organisers can help
    - small numbers of speakers: not so hard to balance program
    - try lightning talks, e.g. recent DublinR 2 male, 3 female
    - low risk inviting new people
   
## Female-friendly R Workshops

- Not restricted to R-ladies groups!

    - female only/ males +1s
    - majority female mentors
- Potential Women in R workshops?
    - beginner workshops in partnership with RUGS
    - summer school for aspiring package developers (Europe 2018)

<!-- from 2006 to 2013 
## Motivating Learning

 - Programming often introduced as
     - a necessary evil
     - a skill required for high-paying jobs
 - Harvey Mudd College increased computer science majors from 10% to &gt; 40%:
     - emphasize creative problem-solving
     - segregate by background/don't let whizz kids dominate
     - showcase women in tech/real case studies
     - provide early opportunities to contribute
-->     
     
<br>    
     
## Google Summer of Code

 1. Mentors/students propose 3 month projects
 2. Google awards a fixed number of student slots
 3. Admins & mentors select projects
    - student earns $5500 
    - mentors benefit from contribution to their project

R's contribution from ideas to implementation managed via GitHub
[github.com/rstats-gsoc](github.com/rstats-gsoc)

## Google Summer of Code
<!--- 23 projects --->

## On Ramps for Contributing

 <div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
<div>
- Several R packages on GitHub have a CONTRIBUTING.md 
    - often not designed for novices
- Target issues at novices
<!--    - many tags in use: first-timers-only / 
    good-starter-issue / low hanging fruit / easy -->
    - use tags
    - step-by-step instructions
